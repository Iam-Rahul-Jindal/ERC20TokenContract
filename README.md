# ERC20TokenContract<br>

### About ERC20<br>
ERC20 tokens are simple and easy to deploy.
The ERC20 standard solves a significant problem, as blockchain-based marketplaces and crypto-wallets need a single, standardized set of commands to communicate with the range of tokens they manage.<br>
It was the first popular specification to offer Ethereum token standardization.<br>

### Library Used - SAfeMath<br>
SafeMath is a Solidity library aimed at dealing with one way hackers have been known to break contracts: integer overflow attack.<br> In such an attack, the hacker forces the contract to use incorrect numeric values by passing parameters that will take the relevant integers past their maximal values.
